Passionate student | Aspiring developer | Coding enthusiast

👋 Hello, I'm Ethan, a dedicated student with a strong passion for programming. I love diving into the world of technology and exploring new possibilities through code.

💻 Currently honing my skills in web development, I enjoy creating user-friendly and visually appealing applications. I'm eager to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with fellow developers.

🌱 Continuously learning and expanding my knowledge in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and more. Embracing every opportunity to grow as a developer and solve interesting problems.

📚 When I'm not coding, you can find me with my nose buried in a book or engaging in outdoor activities like basketball. I believe in the balance of physical and mental well-being.
