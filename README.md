Hello, fellow developers!

I'm Ethan Adams, a passionate student and aspiring software engineer. I have a strong interest in web development and enjoy building interactive and user-friendly applications.

My journey into the world of coding started during my high school years when I developed a fascination for technology. Since then, I've been continuously expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in various programming languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I believe in the power of collaboration and open-source contributions. You can often find me exploring new repositories on GitHub, learning from other developers, and contributing to meaningful projects. I am always eager to embrace new technologies and push the boundaries of what I can create.

Currently, I am pursuing my computer science degree, which further fuels my passion for coding. Through coursework and personal projects, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of algorithms, data structures, and software development principles.

When I'm not busy coding, you'll likely find me engrossed in a good book or playing basketball with friends. I value continuous learning and personal growth both inside and outside the realm of technology.

I'm excited to connect with like-minded developers, collaborate on interesting projects, and make a positive impact on the world through code. If you share similar interests or have any project ideas, feel free to reach out to me. Let's build something amazing together!

Stay curious and keep coding!

Ethan
